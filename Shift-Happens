# Shift Happens - Crypto Challenge

We were given the following ciphertext:

Ukq ckp ia! Dana eo pda bhwc: OS{Cn3wp_SKng_Iu_BahhKs}


Notice that the ciphertext already contains something resembling a flag in the format OS{...}. Since the expected flag format is SW{...}, this hints that the text is simply shifted.

To solve it, we can use a ROT (Caesar shift) decryption tool: https://www.cachesleuth.com/rot.html


1. Paste the ciphertext into the tool.

2. Select ROT All Decrypt.

3. Check each output until you find the correct shift.

At ROT 22, the plaintext appears:
You got me! Here is the flag: SW{Gr3at_WOrk_My_FellOw}

âœ… Final Flag: SW{Gr3at_WOrk_My_FellOw}
